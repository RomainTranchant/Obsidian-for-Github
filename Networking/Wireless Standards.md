The IEEE 802.11 standard governs the WLAN environment. Wireless standards for LANs use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. Collectively these technologies are referred to as Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi Alliance is responsible for testing wireless LAN devices from different manufacturers.

Wireless routers using the 802.11 standards have multiple settings that have to be configured. These settings include the following:

- **Network mode** - Determines the type of technology that must be supported. For example, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n or Mixed Mode.
- **Network Name (SSID)** - Used to identify the WLAN. All devices that wish to participate in the WLAN must have the same SSID.
- **Standard Channel** - Specifies the channel over which communication will occur. By default, this is set to Auto to allow the access point (AP) to determine the optimum channel to use.
- **SSID Broadcast** - Determines if the SSID will be broadcast to all devices within range. By default, set to Enabled.

The 802.11 protocol can provide increased throughput based on the wireless network environment. If all wireless devices connect with the same 802.11 standard, maximum speeds can be obtained for that standard. If the access point is configured to accept only one 802.11 standard, devices that do not use that standard cannot connect to the access point. A mixed mode wireless network environment can include devices that use any of the existing Wi-Fi standards.

When building a wireless network, it is important that the wireless components connect to the appropriate WLAN. This is done using the SSID. The SSID is used to tell wireless devices, called STAs, which WLAN they belong to and with which other devices they can communicate. The SSID broadcast allows other devices and wireless clients to automatically discover the name of the wireless network. When the SSID broadcast is disabled, you must manually enter the SSID on wireless devices.
